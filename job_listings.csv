$200.00","I'm looking to develop an AI assistant that can construct digital versions of people. These avatars should be realistic, mimicking real humans in appearance and behaviour. The AI needs to enable these avatars to: - Change outfits: Users should be able to select from a variety of clothing options. - Walk around: The avatars should have the capability to walk within the chosen background. - Talk naturally: The avatars need to have a custom voice and be able to communicate in a realistic manner. - Act as brand ambassadors: The avatars should be able to showcase products in a convincing manner. The system should be user-friendly, allowing individuals to simply upload a photo or provide a description of their desired avatar. Users can choose different styles (with the primary focus being a realistic style), select outfits, backgrounds, and create a custom voice. The AI should also have the capacity to remember user preferences and previous avatars. The output of the system should be versatile, generating content in the form of: - Videos - GIFs - Images All of which can be used for presentations, social media, or marketing. The central concept of this project is to create adaptable digital humans that appear authentic and can perform various actions on command. This would essentially empower anyone to create their own virtual spokesperson or character without needing advanced technical knowledge. Ideal skills and experience for the job include: - Proficient knowledge of AI and machine learning - Experience in creating realistic digital avatars - Understanding of user-friendly interface design - Capability in developing versatile output formats - Expertise in voice modulation technology. To clarify: -I’m aiming for ultra-realistic human-like avatars, similar to MetaHuman or Synthesia quality — with facial expressions, body motion, and physics-aware interaction. -Users should be able to generate avatars using: Selfies or facial photos (the system should complete the rest of the body using traits like age, gender, skin tone, etc.) -Text prompts or even inspirational reference images for pose/style guidance For now, let’s go with a web-based platform that works smoothly on mobile browsers. We can consider an app version later. Business overview: This project envisions a groundbreaking AI platform that enables users — from creators and marketers to everyday storytellers — to generate high-quality, original digital content by intelligently analyzing existing media and transforming it into fresh, personalized output. At the core of the system is a next-gen AI avatar engine that creates ultra-realistic digital humans from user inputs. These avatars are not generic — they’re deeply personalized, generated through text prompts, selfies, or photo uploads, and enhanced with advanced facial recognition to extract identity features. When a full-body image isn’t provided, the system intelligently maps the user's face onto contextually appropriate body models based on parameters like age, ethnicity, gender, height, and skin tone. The platform also allows users to upload inspirational images, which the AI uses to influence styling, posture, clothing, and motion aesthetics — making the avatar truly reflective of the user’s vision or brand. Every avatar is 360-degree, physics-aware, and capable of natural gestures, motion, and lip-sync across multiple languages and emotional tones. Users can choose from a wide range of AI-generated voices, regional accents, or even cloned voices. In parallel, the system features a media intelligence layer that scrapes and deconstructs any type of input — videos, reels, images, or articles — analyzing structure, tone, gestures, content themes, and model behaviours. Instead of copying, the AI recreates new scripts and visual sequences inspired by the source — ensuring originality while retaining the creative intent. The result is a seamless, highly realistic video or media asset — fully customizable with dynamic backgrounds, lighting, and formats — ready for publishing on Instagram, YouTube Shorts, advertisements, presentations, or digital platforms. This AI system transforms the way content is conceived and created, offering a powerful tool to bridge the gap between inspiration and production. With no need for cameras, actors, studios, or complex editing software, anyone can bring their ideas to life — faster, smarter, and more beautifully than ever before.","Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, AI Development, Illustration, Animation, API"

The prototype focuses on the technological stack; no product-specific (language teaching) features are needed at this stage. Needed features: * Basic LiveKit-based WebRTC voice chat using the OpenAI Realtime speech-to-speech API. * Implementing and handling AI function calls (client and server-side interception). * Server-side real-time transcript monitoring capabilities (accessing the text stream). * Server-side dynamic prompt and conversation history injection mid-session. The primary objective of this project is to de-risk our chosen architecture by proving the technical feasibility of these core real-time AI interactions within a constrained scope. You'll be working with a Python backend, leveraging LiveKit's OpenAI integration. While the long-term vision includes complex learning features, this prototype phase is strictly about validating the low-latency voice pipeline, transcript access, function call mechanisms, and dynamic AI control, ensuring the chosen technologies can support our future goals. Key deliverables will include a functional web client demonstrating the core features, followed by a basic native iOS (Swift/SwiftUI) client integration replicating the essential voice loop and function call logging. An important component will also be a simple backend admin dashboard allowing real-time transcript viewing and manual triggering of prompt/history injection for testing and demonstration purposes.

Benefits: • Clear communication among healthcare teams. • Efficient tracking of clinical progress. • Supports clinical decision-making and legal documentation. ⸻ Future Ideas (Not MVP, but worth considering) • Voice commands (e.g., “Start session”, “Summarise this”) • Highlight flagged clinical terms (e.g., “fever”, “dizziness”) • Multi-language transcription and translation • EMR integration via API (where supported) • Analytics dashboard (e.g., most used templates, time saved)","JavaScript, API, Data Scraping, Python, HTML"

NOTE- ""Candidate edit resume page"" This page represents the general experience for the Web app. It is divided into 3 sections (Navigation-edit-preview) deliberately for the user experience which we would like to maintain as is. ""job seeker home page"" - Not implemented as of yet. There is a little too much text so we need ideas to clean this up as well as some graphics. This is the main page a job seeker lands on to explain options. First impression of how this will work. Looking for very friendly tone easy to understand. From here the user may upload a resume or create one from scratch. ""job seeker waiting page needs graphics..."" This only shows up while user is waiting for the upload to process if user selected to upload an existing resume. Please add graphics and similar instructions as above. ""Candidate edit resume page"" This is our default layout, all our form pages use a very similar style with 3 sections. We believe our design is a little basic and needs some ""fluff""... Just missing that look and feel to complete it. ""company info page"" This is another view of our forms for reference ""download dialogue box"" This is important to our flow. This is a where we obtain log in and will request payment information. This needs to be very friendly and inviting. Feel free to do whatever you feel is right with the dialogue box, or elimiate it all together if this should be it's own page ""layout page"" This is slightly different useage of our 3 column layout. The main thing here is the table, we use the tables/lists in a few different areas. We just wonder if this table/list can be improved or refined? We are content with it, but believe it could be better. All these lists include drag and drop with animations. If you want to see or tweak our animations we can set up a demo. Summary Overall we are happy with our web app because it is clean and functional. However if we can find someone to help us make it look better for the customer market that would be great. If all goes well we will have additional tasks and work in the future. Also, if you have good ideas or can provide samples etc... we are willing to be flexible about the proposed price. We are a small startup and seeking capital at our end to continue moving forward. If this works out it could include an opportunity to be a part of our startup.

The original dev has Apache installed and some Vhosts setup doing stuff I'm not sure of. I can reroute the flow of traffic to a different directory but then I run into issue B. B.) WordPress itself seems to have a hard reference to its URL and even if I redirect server flow, WordPress itself redirects the URLs and I haven't figured out how to change that without blowing everything up (which I did several times, but was able to restore it back). I'd probably rip out his VHost and maybe even apache and put in Nginx with my own Vhosts, then likely sink a day into figuring out why Wordpress wants to go off the rail when you change the url within it's own settings.""
